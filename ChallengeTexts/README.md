# Challenge Texts

For each challenge text, create a markdown file named <challengename>.md, substituting <challengename> for each of the challenges. 

Keep the files in this folder.

The format of the challenge texts can change depending on the needs of the project, however all challenges need to be in the same format for consistency.

In each example, list the module that is being targetted and the text itself, as well as any other relevant detail.

An example is given.
